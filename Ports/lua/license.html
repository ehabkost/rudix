Before Lua 5.0,
Lua used its own license, which were very close to the
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html">zlib license</A>
and others,
but not quite the same.
Check the
<A HREF="ftp/">source distribution</A>
for the exact license text
for each version before Lua 5.0.
Nevertheless,
if you wish to use those old versions,
you may hereby assume that
they have all been re-licensed under the MIT license.
