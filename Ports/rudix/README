Rudix Package Manager
=====================

About
-----

The `rudix` utility is a package manager therefore you can install, remove,
print information about packages and search files under the Rudix domain.
It is possible to verify the integrity of installed packages and to fix (repair) packages.

Every package has a unique identification (called package-id) and you may refer to Rudix packages
by using its full package-id or with its alias. For example,
`org.rudix.pkg.ccache` is a `package-id` and `ccache` is an alias for it.

Without any arguments provided, `rudix` prints a list of packages installed.

Usage
-----

    rudix			# list packages
    sudo rudix install wget	# install wget
    sudo rudix remove wgett	# remove wget
    rudix available    		# list available packages for installation
    rudix help			# Help

See `rudix(1)` manual page for extensive information.
